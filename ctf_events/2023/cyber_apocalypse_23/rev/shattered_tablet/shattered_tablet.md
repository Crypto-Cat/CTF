# Shattered Tablet

## Description

> Deep in an ancient tomb, you've discovered a stone tablet with secret information on the locations of other relics. However, while dodging a poison dart, it slipped from your hands and shattered into hundreds of pieces. Can you reassemble it and read the clues?

## Solution

Used chatGPT, ghidra, GDB and some brute force to get the flag!

Flag: `HTB{br0k3n_4p4rt,n3ver_t0_b3_r3p41r3d}`
